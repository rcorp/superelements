**Super, Fantastic, Easy, Beautiful, Customisable, Interoperable Web Components.**

##Interoperable
> *Why can't I use an element from [Polymer](https://elements.polymer-project.org/) that fits in a [Bricks](http://brick.mozilla.io/) element working together from a component from [expand js](http://expandjs.com)? :(*

Web Component Libraries are built around walled gardens, effectively destroying their utility. Components need to be more like HTML. Seamlessly working together without raising any conflicts!

##Super Fantastically Easy!
> *Got a requirement from the marketing team. I just added ONE TAG and voila! I'm done! :)*

Web Components are supposed to make development real easy. Better get back to jQuery plugins if your elements are not solving this!


##Customisable
> *Uhmmm... Yeah you made that with one tag, that's great and all, but can you please change this to this? and then this to this? and finally this?*

Web Components aren't supposed to make you horrified when faced with "such adversities".

##Beautiful

> *I'll do the CSS later, just see if it works for now!*

Tired of hearing / saying this? Web Components should be usable right out of the box. The **SuperElements** team has talented UX specialists and here too we invite community feedback!

**After years and years of pioneering Web Development, the [creators of superelements]() know what Web Developers need.**

But there can be multiple approaches to solve those needs. We claim we may not be able to solve **all** of those needs the **perfect** way, but we strongly believe that **you** do. **Super Elements** relies heavily on 
community feedback to architect and design each of our components.
