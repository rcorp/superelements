## Super

The Web Developer community is really large and really active. Over the years we have seen some fantastic Open Source Projects spring up. Unfortunately, so much of activity has resulted in a lot of loss of focus.

Instead of trying to re - invent the wheel, or think in a limited manner, why don't we focus all our energies collaboratively to bring the Web UI forward?

This is our approach:

1. Is there an existing Web Component Library, which solves our requirements? *Formally Contribute there! Make a note here!*
2. Is there an existing library in use which isn't a Web Component? *Web Componetize it! Push here!*
3. Is there no existing library to solve our requirements / An existing library where we are not able to contribute? *yo WebComponent here!*

## Beautiful

> *I'll do the CSS later, just see if it works for now!*

Tired of hearing / saying this? Web Components should be usable right out of the box. The **SuperElements** team has talented UX specialists and here too we invite community feedback!

## Fantastically Easy!
> *Got a requirement from the marketing team. I just added ONE TAG and voila! I'm done! :)*

Web Components are supposed to make development real easy. Better get back to jQuery plugins if your elements are not solving this!

## Interoperable
> *Why can't I use an element from [Polymer](https://elements.polymer-project.org/) that fits in a [Bricks](http://brick.mozilla.io/) element working together from a component from [expand js](http://expandjs.com)? :(*

Web Component Libraries are built around walled gardens, effectively destroying their utility. Components need to be more like HTML. Seamlessly working together without raising any conflicts!

**SuperElements** architecture tries to model HTML Specs as much as possible, while at the same time keeping an eye out for implementations in the wild like Polymer, ExapandJS, Dojo Toolkit, WinJS and more... Where we can, we contribute to these projects. Where we can't (or not necessarily find agreement with), we model it ourselves with best practices.

## Customisable
> *Uhmmm... Yeah you made that with one tag, that's great and all, but can you please change this to this? and then this to this? and finally this?*

Web Components aren't supposed to make you horrified when faced with "such adversities".

**After years and years of pioneering Web Development, the [creators of superelements](http://www.rcorp.co.in) know what Web Developers need.**

But there can be multiple approaches to solve those needs. We claim we may not be able to solve **all** of those needs the **perfect** way, but we strongly believe that **you** do. **Super Elements** relies heavily on community feedback to architect and design each of our components.

##Contrubution & Community Feedback

We would love to hear from you and we feel GitHUB is the best place for you to:
